# Statistical Learning Project

This project is a supervised learning project aiming to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. 

To build and select an optimal supervised model, we first cleaned the data, and then used feature selection methods to reduce the number of variables to 34.  After that, we built supervised classification models: Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, KNN, Random Forests.
